# Techdegree_Project_Unit2

I am using a common web development technique known as "pagination" to enhance the usability of a web page.

Starting with a page that contains a list of 54 student names, photos and email addresses; my code to displays 10 names at a time, and adds a navigation system to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time.

My code is flexible enough to respond to lists of different lengths of students , not just my examples.
